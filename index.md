Hi, there. I'm William, a Master student in Economics at WISE, Xiamen University, China. I'm glad that you are interested in this personal website, which is devoted to share with you all my research works and personal stuff. And I hope that you find yourself enjoyed looking for what you need.

喜悦的伤感,还有忧郁的欢乐,就像孩童时代的田字格,简单地交错杂织,我却一直都认为它们是最复杂的星象图,自己似乎永远也写不好那些脆弱的线条,悟不透那些擦破天际的逆轨.还有很多的事,已经不能完成的,没能想要完成的,还有来不及完成的,就像纯洁的田字格,想好好写下灿烂如莲花绽放.
